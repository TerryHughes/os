# os

This is an attempt to build an operating system from scratch (including the bootloader, assembler, compiler, etc). The purpose of this is to level up my C skill and work closer to the actual hardware and how a computer really works. Ultimately, I would like to be able to boot into the OS from a USB drive and launch a game with all the software involved in doing that written by hand.
